# UnrealIRCd Modules Collection

Hey! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to this collection of modules made for UnrealIRCd. If you're running an UnrealIRCd server and want to extend its functionality, you might find something useful here.

## Important Stuff

Before you dive in, here are a few things to keep in mind:

- **Check the README for Each Module**: Every module has its own README file. Make sure you read that before trying to use the module! Itâ€™ll tell you what the module does, how to configure it, and any specific details you need to know.
  
- **Be Careful!**: These modules can change how UnrealIRCd works, so always test them out before you run them on a live server. You (and I) donâ€™t want to accidentally break things!

- **Compatibility**: Some modules might only work with certain versions of UnrealIRCd or need other libraries. Youâ€™ll find all that info in the README of the specific module.

## Whatâ€™s Inside?

Hereâ€™s a quick list of the modules you can find here:

- **NickCollator:** Blocks nick names based on your custom character mappings, even across character sets.
- **wwwstats:** Share statistics through a UNIX socket, providing real-time insights on server activity.

Iâ€™ll keep adding more as I work on them!

## Disclaimer (aka "Please Donâ€™t Break Your Server")

Iâ€™m just a beginner in programming, and these modules are a work in progress. So, use them at your own risk! I try to make sure everything works, but if something goes wrong, I canâ€™t take responsibility for it. Make backups and test in a safe environment first!

## Want to Help?

If you know how to improve these modules or if you find a bug, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. Iâ€™m always open to suggestions and learning from others!

## License

Licenses for each module can be found in their respective directories.
